CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization
During this course, I created a scene using 3D shapes and lighting with OpenGL. Users can navigate this scene with the camera using Keyboard and mouse input devices.  

How do I approach designing software?

When I approach software design, I start by understanding the design specifications and then write my code. I constantly review and test my code to improve its functionality and maintainability. I always follow best coding practices, including adding line comments and input validation, to ensure that the code is reusable and readable.
Additionally, I use UML diagrams or flowcharts to help me plan the software design before implementing the code.

How do I approach developing programs?

For the 3D scene I created, I implemented a modular design to separate my code into different functions. I developed the code for my final project using functions such as shaders, texture, input, and main code. This approach made my code organized, reusable, and easy to maintain. Throughout the project, I made constant changes to the code to improve the performance and the visual appearance of the scene. In my opinion, lighting and camera input were the most important aspects of this project. Tweaking the lighting and providing more input devices like a keyboard and mouse enhanced the user experience. My approach did not change much from week to week as I learned new skills like lighting, camera work, and 3D shapes and applied them to my final project.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

During this course, I created a scene using 3D shapes and lighting using OpenGL. Users can navigate this scene with the camera using Keyboard and mouse input devices.  
The skills I have learned during the course will be valuable for my future courses. The knowledge I gained from coding with vectors, input devices, and different light sources will assist me in creating scenes throughout my educational journey. Professionally, I believe this class will help me pursue a career in graphics design, such as video game development. During this course, I gained a deeper respect for video game design. The lighting aspect of this course presented the most difficulty for me. I can only imagine that creating an entire 3D game must be challenging.
